    @brief rem_pio2

    @c rem_pio2 compute the remainder modulo \f$\pi/2\f$ with cephes algorthm,
    and return the angle quadrant between 0 and 3.
    This is the always accurate super costly version.
    This function is mainly for internal purposes
    \par
    The reduction of the argument modulo \f$pi/2\f$ is generally
    the most difficult part of trigonometric evaluations.
    The accurate algorithm is over costly and implies the knowledge
    of a few hundred \f$pi\f$ decimals
    some simpler algorithms
    can be used, but the precision is only insured on smaller intervals.

    @param a0 angle in radian

    @return the fusion vector : integer value of the quadrant,
     reduced angle and eventual coorection
