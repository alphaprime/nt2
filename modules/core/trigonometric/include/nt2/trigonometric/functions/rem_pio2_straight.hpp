    @brief rem_pio2_straight

    and return an angle quadrant which is always 1.
    This is a very quick version accurate if the input
    is in \f$[\pi/4,\pi/2\f$. In fact it only subsstract \f$\pi/2\f$ to the input
    so it can be viewed as a specially accurate minuspio_2 function outside
    the interval in which it can be used as a substitute to rem_pio2.
    The reduction of the argument modulo \f$pi/2\f$ is generally
    the most difficult part of trigonometric evaluations.
    The accurate algorithm is over costly and implies the knowledge
    of a few hundred \f$pi\f$ decimals
    some simpler algorithms as this one
    can be used, but the precision is only insured on specific intervals.
